    <h1>Cajun Jambalaya</h1>
    <img class="secondarypic" src="../images/cajun.jpeg">
    <p>One of the signature dishes of South Louisiana cuisine, <br>
        Jambalaya is a heartwarming amalgamation of flavors, of which, properly prepared, no single ingredient predominate.<br>
        This classic Louisiana rice dish captures wonderful Creole and Cajun flavors and is often imitated, but rarely duplicated,<br>
        outside of Louisiana. This is Sweet Daddy D’s Cajun Jambalaya made with pork, sausage, and chicken.<br>
        Judging from the result, you won’t believe that it is really simple and no-angst. Perfect for a crowd, too!</p>
