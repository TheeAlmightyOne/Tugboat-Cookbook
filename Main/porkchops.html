         <li>1 tablespoon Creole seasoning</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon dry oregano</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon dry basil</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon dry thyme</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper Optional</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
     </ul>
     </div>
     <h4>Dredge</h4>
     <div class="list">
     <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>⅔ cup AP flour</li>
     </ul>
     </div>
     <h2>What You Need To Do</h2>
     <h4>Sear the pork chops</h4>
     <div class="list">
     <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork chops and pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of the chops with kosher salt and 
            ground black pepper and let sit for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the ingredients for the dredge.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork chops in the dredge mix and shake off the excess.</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, sear the pork chops on both sides for about 3 to 4 minutes.
             Set aside on paper towels. Do this in batches so you don't crowd the pan.</li>
     </ol>
     </div>
     <h4>Make The Gravy</h4>
     <div class="list">
         <ol>
        <li>If there are any burned morsels in the dutch oven, wipe out with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Set the heat to medium over under the dutch oven and add the butter.</li>
        <li>When the butter is frothy add the AP flour and stir constantly to make a light roux.
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> The roux will be very thin because of the 4:1 ratio of butter to flour,
             but with the long cook, it will still serve to thicken the gravy.</li>
        <li>Add the yellow onions and stir until starting to wilt about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using the mushroom, add them about halfway through (after about 4 minutes) sauteeing the onions.</li>
        <li>When the onions are wilted, add the garlic and the Herb and Spice Blend. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Saute until the garlic is aromatic, which will only take about 2-3 minutes. Stir constantly.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Stir in the white wine and simmer until the wine has reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. 
            Use the wine to deglaze the pan if necessary by scraping the bits of food off the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the stock. Bring the stock to a high simmer and continue for about 5 minutes.</li>
     </ol>
     </div>
     <h4>Smother Dem Chops</h4>
     <div class="list">
     <ol>
        <li>Add the pork chops back to the pot. Stir and move them around so that they are all covered with the gravy.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to a low simmer, cover the Dutch oven and simmer for 1 hour. Stir the pot thoroughly every 15 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, continue to simmer with the pot partially covered for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Check the pork chops for tenderness and continue to simmer until very tender. Taste the gravy for seasoning and add more if needed.
             Add more reserved stock if the gravy is too thick. Place the lid on completely or partially depending upon how thick you want the gravy.</li>
        <li>Once the chops are tender and falling apart, serve immediately over rice.</li>
     </ol>
     </div>
     <h2>Things To Know</h2>
     <p>Many commerical Creole seasoning and stocks have a lot of salt,
         so make sure to taste the gravy before adding more.</p>
