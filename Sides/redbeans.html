    <p>If you could put New Orleans on a plate and eat it, it would look and taste like Red Beans and Rice.
         A pot of red beans slowly simmering with seasoning meat and the Trinity represents the simple and frugal character of
          South Louisiana cuisine; inexpensive ingredients and uncomplicated cooking methods. It doesnâ€™t get much simpler than 
           Red Beans and Rice.</p>
